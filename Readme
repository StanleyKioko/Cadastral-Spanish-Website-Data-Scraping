# Cadastral Reference Scraper

This project automates the extraction of property information from the Spanish Cadastre website using Selenium and a list of cadastral references.

## Features

- Reads a list of cadastral references from a CSV file.
- Navigates the official Cadastre website and searches each reference.
- Extracts key property data, including:
  - **Uso principal** (Main Use)
  - **Superficie construida** (Built Area)
- Handles errors, retries failed attempts, and logs progress.
- Saves results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (automatically managed)
- Internet connection

### Python Packages

Install dependencies with:

```
pip install selenium webdriver-manager pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your input file**  
   Place your cadastral references (one per line) in a file named cadastral_references.csv in the project directory.

2. **Run the scraper**

   ```
   python scrape_cadastre.py
   ```

3. **Check results**  
   The script will create or append to `cadastre_results.csv` with the extracted data.

## Output

The output CSV will have columns:

- `Reference`
- `Uso principal`
- `Superficie construida`

## Notes

- The script uses a visible Chrome window for debugging. To run headless, uncomment the `--headless` option in the script.
- If the input file is missing, the script will log an error and exit.
- The script includes retry logic for robustness against network or site issues.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure Chrome is installed and up to date.
- If you encounter issues with ChromeDriver, delete any cached drivers and rerun the script.
- For large lists, consider increasing delays or splitting the input file to avoid rate limits.
